This is a project that is currently a work in progress.It works right now for 22 tournaments. In order for the program to work the user must run the startdata.py file to create the database tables. Comment out the drop table if the database file is empty. Then run the scraper.py file to populate the tables. This scrapes the website for the tournaments provided and populates the tables with the data from all of those games. Then you can run the flask application in a virtual environment. To install flask go here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/. You can start the application with flask --app flaskr run --debug. I will update the html to make it more pleasant, but for now it works as it will randomly select one game and paste the bans and pick images on the page. The tournament is entered first through a select field. The select fields were created using chosen jquery plugin. Then if the user gets the tournament correct they are redirected to a select field for the game played. They must make sure the first team mentioned is the blue team in this game. If the user inputs/selects 5 wrong values it redirects to a page that prints the correct answser and that the user got it wrong. If they get it all right it instead redirects to a page that prints all the correct info and a congratulatory message.
