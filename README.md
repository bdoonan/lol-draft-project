This is a project that is currently a work in progress.It works right now for one tournament. In order for the program to work the user must run the startdata.py file to create the database tables. Comment out the drop table if the database file is empty. Then run the scraper.py file to populate the tables. This scrapes the website for the 2016 Worlds tournament and populates the tables with the data from all of those games. Then you can run the flask application with flask --app flaskr run --debug. I will update the html to make it more pleasent, but for now it works as it will randomly select one game and paste the bans and pick images on the page. The tournament is entered in an input field and is "2016 Worlds" for all possible values. The teams playing against each other are selected through a select field with the blue team on the left and the red team on the right. I could not find a way to set the game parameter as it varies based on series, so for now all game values are 1 so that is inputed last. If the user inputs/selects 5 wrong values it redirects to a page that prints the correct answser and that the user got it wrong. If they get it all right it instead redirects to a page that prints all the correct info and a congratulatory message.
