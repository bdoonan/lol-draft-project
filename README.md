This is a project that is currently a work in progress. I am working on making an application where the user has to guess the pro league of legends game based on provided draft using flask. I am first working on on making it work for one draft, then I will try to make it so that it randomly selects a draft, then I will try to potentially find a way to scrape draft data instead of manually creating the drafts.
